# Adventurer

This is my cli project that allows you easy access to Race and Class information from the 5e Dungeons & Dragons Player's Handbook. Users can browse through all 5e standard races and classes and view information specific to each.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'adventurer'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install adventurer

## Usage



## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
